# Issue 1: In get_max_range_speed() - Wrong weight parameter in trimSolve
# Current (WRONG):
# trimSolve(..., W=self.dryweight, D=D, ...)

# Should be (CORRECT):
# trimSolve(..., W=weight*g, D=D, ...)

# Issue 2: In get_max_endurance_speed() - Same wrong weight parameter
# Current (WRONG):
# trimSolve(..., W=self.dryweight, D=D, ...)

# Should be (CORRECT):
# trimSolve(..., W=weight*g, D=D, ...)

# Issue 3: In get_max_range() - Fuel consumption logic may be inefficient
# The while loop might be very slow for large fuel tanks

# Issue 4: In get_endurance() - Same efficiency issue

# Issue 5: No error handling for trim solver failures

# Issue 6: Hard-coded rotor parameters in trimSolve calls
# Should probably be configurable
